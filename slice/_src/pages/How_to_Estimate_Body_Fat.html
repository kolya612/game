                    Simply weighing yourself every week doesn’t provide enough information to determine your
                    progression. For example, if you gain muscle and lose fat, your weight may stay the same; but,
                    your body composition would be improved. It is very important to measure and log your body fat
                    at least once per month and your weight weekly. Below, you’ll find different ways to calculate
                    body fat. Some methods are more accurate than others. Whichever method you use, be sure you use
                    the same method each time for accurate benchmarking.

                <h3 class="title">Estimate Your Body Fat Using the Navy Seal Formula</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    This is not as accurate as the methods below but can provide a convenient guess-timate. For this
                    method, you’ll need a soft tape measure and a scale.

                    the Navy
                    Seal Formula.

                <h3 class="title">Dual-Energy X-Ray Scan</h3>
                <p class="text">A DEXA Scan will provide the most accurate and precise breakdown of your
                    distribution of body fat and muscle tissue. You find out overall body fat, lean body mass, bone
                    weight and percentages of each in each region. It also reveals potentially dangerous fat
                    surrounding vital organs and allows you to track changes over time. It’s by far the best
                    mechanism to objectively measure your progress. You can Google locations of DEXA Scans near you
                    that are very common and usually reasonably priced.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Hydrostatic Method</h3>
                <p class="text">This method calculates body fat percentage based off of body density. Imagine a
                    water dunk tank but in a medical setting. After being weighed outside of the water, you sit in a
                    chair that is lowered into the water. Once submerged, you exhale as much air from your lungs as
                    possible. Your weight is then calculated. Although it’s considered a highly accurate method to
                    measure total body fat, it will not provide distribution of fat by body part or region like
                    DEXA. And, it’s not as convenient as some of the other methods.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Skinfold Caliper Method</h3>
                <p class="text">Use this plier-shaped instrument to measure thickness of skin. You can order a
                    skinfold caliper for a few dollars from Amazon. There are different formulas for this method,
                    but we highly recommend using the 7-Site Skinfold Method for the most accurate reading. You will
                    measure the thickness of your skin in 7 specific locations on your body and enter those
                    measurements into the formula below to determine your total body fat percentage. This is a very
                    accurate way to measure total body fat. It’s also more convenient and affordable than most
                    alternatives. <a class="link" href="#">Click here</a> to watch this tutorial video about how to
                    perform a 7-point skinfold
                    accurately. Then, <a class="link" href="#">click here</a> to enter your results in this formula
                    that determines your total
                    body-fat percentage.</p>

                <h3 class="title">BIA (Bio Impedance Analysis) </h3>
                <p class="text">One of the most popular types of BIA is the InBody brand. It is essentially a scale
                    that also measures body fat. Although bio impedance is very convenient, as convenient as
                    weighing yourself, it is definitely the least accurate method because the algorithm used to
                    determine your body fat doesn’t actually measure your body fat but provides an estimate based
                    upon many different variables. The problem: those variables also vary, depending on things that
                    have nothing to do with actual body fat. However, if you use the same device each month at the
                    same time of day, with the same level of food and water in your system, BIA can be used as a
                    fair benchmarking tool. To determine if you’re trending in the right direction, we recommend
                    using the same device at least once a month. Do this first thing in the morning on an empty
                    stomach to get the most accurate reads. Bio impedance devices like InBody are very common and
                    can be found through Google search.</p>
